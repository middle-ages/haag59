# Rename workspace images to work around GitHub repository image caching
#
# Run to prepare a commit that changed workspace, so that when it is commited,
# all images have been renamed to a previously unused name. This is needed
# because GitHub image caches do not refresh correctly. The new version will
# feature new URLs for every workspace image thus avoid GitHub caching.
